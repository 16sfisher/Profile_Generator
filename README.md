# Profile_Generator

This project prompts the user with two questions: What is their GitHub username and what's their favorite color?
Based off the user's input, a profile will be generated into a readable PDF file that displays the their github username, profile picture, a link to their github, a link to their blog, a breif bio, number of public repos, number of followers, number of people they follow, number of stars they've received, and their location.

All this information comes from an axios call to the GitHub API. The input of their favorite color will generate the card to be that specific color.
